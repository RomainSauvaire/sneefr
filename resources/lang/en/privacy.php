For professional sellers, Sidewalks may also require your social security number, identification ID, tax ID, date of birth, bank account information, or other proof of identification to confirm your identity, comply with applicable law, and to make sure we are offering you great service. Sidewalks itself does not store your credit card information; however, Sidewalks works with a third party payment service provider that might need to store your credit card information for both billing and payment purposes.

In order to contact you, however, people need to log into their Sidewalks account. You can edit most of your personal information when logged into your account. For instance, if you have shared your location or identified places of interest, you can edit that information in your settings or in your places of interest link. Sidewalks also lets you enable our properties to access your mobile device’s camera and picture library to upload photographs to Sidewalks.

If a Sidewalks account is deleted and a new one created using the same Facebook account, the evaluations from the first Sidewalks account will appear on the second account.

Each person in the transaction agrees to respect the other person’s privacy by not sharing the information with others and by not using the information for any non-Sidewalks purpose. For instance, you may not post the other person’s information online and you may not use their information for unsolicited commercial emails, mailings, or other transactions without that user’s express written consent.
